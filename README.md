# Zype_TA_Kaggle_TrendingYouTubeVideoStatistics
Scenario: There is a public dataset available at Kaggle.com for youtube video statistics that we would like you to use for this little lab. This dataset includes multiple datasets, so we are going to narrow it down to the CAvideos.csv(actual data) and CA_category_id.json (categories lookup). https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new?select=CAvideos.csv
